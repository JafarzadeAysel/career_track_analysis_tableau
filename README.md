## Project Objective
Exploring Student Enrollments and Completions in Data-Related Career Tracks on the 365 Data Science Platform

## Dataset used 
<a href = "https://github.com/JafarzadeAysel/career_track_analysis_tableau/blob/main/career_track_dataset.csv">career_track_dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
1. What is the number of enrolled students monthly? Which is the month with the most enrollments?
2. Which career track do students enroll most in?
3. What is the career track completion rate?
4. How long does it typically take students to complete a career track?
5. What type of subscription is most suitable for students who aim to complete a career track: monthly, quarterly, or annual?


## Steps
* Extracting Data with MySQL Using Joins, DATEDIFF, and ROW_NUMBER Functions
* Creating a Combo Chart in Tableau to visualize Track Enrollments by Months and  completion percentage
* Creating a Bar Chart in Tableau to display Track Enrollments by Completion buckets
* Interpreting the Results
